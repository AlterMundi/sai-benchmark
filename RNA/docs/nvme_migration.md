# SAI Dataset Migration to NVMe - Performance Optimization

**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Migration**: RAID1 HDDs → NVMe SSD  
**Purpose**: Eliminate GPU starvation and accelerate training by 30-70%  

## 🎯 Migration Summary

### Performance Issue Identified
During integrity testing, observed GPU starvation pattern:
1. **GPU working** → Processing current batch
2. **GPU idle + HDD activity** → Loading next batch from RAID (265 MB/s)
3. **GPU working** → Processing loaded batch
4. **Repeat cycle** → Inefficient training loop

### Root Cause Analysis
```python
# Training bottleneck calculation
batch_size = 16
image_size = ~200KB average
data_per_batch = 16 × 200KB = 3.2MB

# RAID mechanical disk performance
raid_speed = 265 MB/s sequential
random_access_penalty = ~0.1-0.5s (mechanical latency)
actual_load_time = 0.1-0.5s per batch

# GPU processing time
gpu_time = 1/11.8 it/s = ~0.085s per batch

# Problem: load_time > gpu_time = GPU STARVATION
```

### Storage Strategy
**Hybrid approach** to optimize for both speed and backup:

#### NVMe (Speed-Critical)
```
/mnt/n8n-data/sai-benchmark/
├── RNA/data/mega_fire_dataset/     # 7.6GB - Training dataset
├── RNA/configs/                    # Configurations
├── RNA/training/venv/              # Virtual environment
├── RNA/scripts/                    # Training scripts
└── start_*.sh                      # Training launchers
Total: ~15GB
```

#### RAID1 (Backup & Storage)
```
/mnt/raid1/sai-benchmark/
├── RNA/data/raw/                   # Original datasets (48GB)
├── RNA/training/runs/              # Training outputs
├── RNA/weights/                    # Final model weights
└── backups/                        # Project backups
Total: ~55GB
```

## 📊 Migration Process

### Step 1: Space Verification
```bash
# Available space check
NVMe available: 63GB
Project size needed: ~15GB
Migration: ✅ FEASIBLE
```

### Step 2: Strategic Copy
```bash
# Dataset migration (1m39s)
cp -r /mnt/raid1/sai-benchmark/RNA/data/mega_fire_dataset /mnt/n8n-data/sai-benchmark/RNA/data/
# Speed: ~77 MB/s average

# Essential files
cp -r configs/ scripts/ docs/ training/venv/ start_*.sh
```

### Step 3: Configuration Update
```yaml
# Updated dataset.yaml path
path: /mnt/n8n-data/sai-benchmark/RNA/data/mega_fire_dataset
```

### Step 4: Integrity Verification
```bash
# Dataset integrity check
Training images: 51,200 ✅
Validation images: 12,800 ✅
Total images: 64,000 ✅
Labels: 63,999 ✅
```

## ⚡ Expected Performance Gains

### Training Speed Improvement
```python
# Conservative estimates
current_time = 15-20 hours  # RAID mechanical
nvme_time = 10-13 hours     # NVMe optimized
time_saved = 5-7 hours      # 30-40% improvement

# Optimistic estimates (with full GPU utilization)
best_case_time = 8-10 hours  # 50-60% improvement
```

### GPU Utilization Optimization
